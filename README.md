a little morse game (the typo in title is intentional, so not really a typo)

needs windoes, no idea what happens if you use it on some other system

all quotes were scraped from some random good reads page. there are some arabic codes over there, i.e., quotes in the arabic script. I could have filtered them out, but just felt that it wasn't worth the effort. So you gotta deal with it. and because I was expecting the latin script, and morse code is designed for the latin script, either the morse code will not be generated or the stupid thing will throw some error, I don't have a clue.

Is it laziness? Perhaps
